# ProgrammingTechniques_A1

The aim of this assignment is to design and implement a polynomial calculator with a dedicated graphical interface through which the user can enter polynomials, select the operation to be performed (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, derivative, integration) and display the result. The polynomials considered will be of one variable and will have integer coefficients.
